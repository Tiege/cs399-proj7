# proj7-Gcal
#Building off of proj6-Gcal the app now displays the available free times instead of the busy times
#Also included some nose tests to help facilitate testing

This program connectes to a prespecified google calendar client and displays the 'free' times for whichever set of calendars the user chooses.

#NOTES:
If you select a date range that spans over too much free times in your calendar, the app will time out.

Run tests using nosetests from python-nose
